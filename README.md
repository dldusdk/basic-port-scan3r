# basic-port-scan3r
A basic python program that scans for open and closed ports. You must target IP address and open-end port range. It calculates a vulnerability score depending on the port open and how many ports are open.

Made as a personal project for educational purposes only. Please do not use this to scan unathorized networks!!!
